## Setup

Do not use `venv`, it only introduces problems. Do `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade -y` first. 
Always call pip indirectly, like `sudo -H python3 -m pip install $FOO`.

Follow the specific instructions for `luma` and `numpy`, if problems arise.

## Current Problems

The mh_z19 sensor is not recognized.

## Next Up

* Buy an appropriate power supply
* Buy a, um, cable combinator (the problem is probably due to shitty connections on DIY taped together wires - we need this, because the monitor and the sensor share ports)
